# File-System-Simulator-A-Visual-Learning-Tool-
This project aims to develop a fully interactive, GUI-based File System Simulator that allows users  to create, delete, and manage files visually instead of using command-line commands. By simulating  file storage, allocation strategies, and memory usage, our system will provide a hands-on, engaging  way to understand OS-level file management.
